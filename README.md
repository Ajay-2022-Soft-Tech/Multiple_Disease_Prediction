# Multi-Disease Prediction System

This web app uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. The app is built with Streamlit and a trained model saved as `trained_model.sav`.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**
- **Heart Disease Prediction**
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Anaconda (Recommended)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-disease-prediction.git
cd multi-disease-prediction
Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash
Copy code
conda create --name disease-prediction-env python=3.8
conda activate disease-prediction-env
Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using pip.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Trained Model
Ensure you have the trained_model.sav file in the project directory. If not, download it from here.

Configuration
Update Model Path in Multiple_Disease_Pred.py
Open the Multiple_Disease_Pred.py file and update the path to the trained model file. Change the variable that loads the model to the correct path.

python
Copy code
import pickle

# Load the trained model
model_path = "path_to_your_model/trained_model.sav"
model = pickle.load(open(model_path, 'rb'))
Replace path_to_your_model/trained_model.sav with the actual path to your trained_model.sav file.

Running the App
Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):

bash
Copy code
conda activate disease-prediction-env
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run path_to_/Multiple_Disease_Pred.py
Open the app in your browser:

Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) where you can interact with the web app.

Usage
Select the disease you want to predict from the sidebar.
Enter the required details in the input fields.
Click on the 'Predict' button to see the results.
File Structure
Multiple_Disease_Pred.py: The main application file for Streamlit.
trained_model.sav: The pre-trained machine learning model.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
